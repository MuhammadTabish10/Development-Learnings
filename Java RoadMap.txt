JAVA DEVELOPMENT ROAD MAP....

1) Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
   --> Master concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.
   
2) Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):
   --> Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, hashmaps, sets, trees, and graphs.
   --> Sorting and searching algorithms, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.

3) Java Basics:
   --> JVM architecture (Heap, Stack, Garbage Collection).
   --> Primitive vs. wrapper classes, String handling, and collections framework.
   
4) Multithreading and Concurrency:
   --> Study threads, thread pools, synchronization, and locks.
   --> Java.util.concurrent package (e.g. Executors, Callable, Future).
   
5) Java 8+ Features:
   --> Streams, lambdas, functional interfaces, and method references.
   --> Optional, CompletableFuture, and new APIs (e.g. Date-Time API).
   
6) Reflection API:
   --> Analyze and manipulate classes, methods, fields, and annotations at runtime using java.lang.reflect.
   
7) Generics:
   --> Dive deep into bounded types (<T extends Class>).
   --> Wildcards (? extends and ? super) and their use cases.
   
8) Class Loaders:
   --> Java ClassLoader hierarchy (Bootstrap, Extension, Application).
   --> Custom class loading and its application in modular systems.
   
9) JVM Internals:
   --> JVM internals like class loading, bytecode, and garbage collection algorithms (CMS, G1, ZGC).
   --> Performance monitoring and tuning with tools like JVisualVM and JConsole.
   
10) Serialization and Deserialization:
	--> Serialize objects using Serializable and Externalizable.
	--> Understand pitfalls like serialVersionUID.
	
11) Java Networking:
    --> Socket programming (TCP, UDP).
	--> Work with HttpClient for building HTTP-based clients.
	
12) Dynamic Proxy:
    --> Create dynamic proxies using java.lang.reflect.Proxy.
	--> Understand how it is used in frameworks like Spring and Hibernate.
	
13) Functional Programming with Java:
	--> Explore advanced functional programming concepts using Java Streams and Collectors.
	--> Build custom collectors and use parallel streams. 
	
14) Modules (Java 9+):
    --> Learn the Java Platform Module System (JPMS).
    --> Modularize applications using module-info.java.
	
15) Memory Model and Volatile:
    --> Java Memory Model (JMM) and how volatile works.
    --> Study the happens-before relationship.
	
16) Java Native Interface (JNI):
    --> Learn how to call native C/C++ code from Java.
    --> Understand when and why JNI is used.
	
17) Core Spring:
	--> Dependency Injection, ApplicationContext, and Bean Lifecycle.
    --> AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) and Spring Profiles.
	
18) Spring Boot:
    --> Spring Boot starters, auto-configuration, and application properties.
	--> Spring Data JPA (CRUD, Criteria API, JPQL).
	--> Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
	
19) Testing:
    --> Unit tests using JUnit and Mockito.
	--> Test Spring Boot applications using @WebMvcTest and @SpringBootTest.
	
20) Design Patterns:
	--> Singleton, Factory, Builder, Strategy, Observer, and Dependency Injection.
	--> Study practical use cases for each pattern.

21) Best Practices:
	--> SOLID principles)
	--> Use tools like SonarQube for static code analysis.

22) Security:
    --> JWT, OAuth2, CSRF, and HTTPS configurations.

23) Microservices Fundamentals:
	--> Domain-Driven Design (DDD).
	--> Decoupled services with independent deployment.
	--> Scalability and resilience.
	
24) Spring Cloud for Microservices:
	--> Service Discovery: Eureka.
    --> API Gateway: Spring Cloud Gateway or Netflix Zuul.
    --> Load Balancing: Ribbon.
    --> Circuit Breakers: Resilience4j or Hystrix.
	
25) Inter-Service Communication:
    --> Implement synchronous communication with REST and Feign clients.
    --> Learn asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ, Kafka, or gRPC.

26) Service Configuration:
	--> Use Spring Cloud Config Server for centralized configuration.
	--> Secure configurations using Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.
	
27) Observability and Monitoring:
	--> Implement distributed tracing with tools like Zipkin or Jaeger.
	--> Monitor services with Prometheus and Grafana.
	--> Log aggregations using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Fluentd.
	
28) Data Management:
    --> Database per service.
    --> Event-driven data consistency (Saga Pattern, CQRS).
	
29) Deployment:
	--> Containerize microservices with Docker.
	--> Orchestrate and deploy microservices on Kubernetes.
	
30) Best Practices:
	--> Implement resilience patterns (Circuit Breaker, Retry).
	--> Design APIs with proper versioning and backward compatibility.
	
31) CI/CD:
    --> Automate builds and deployments using Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions.
